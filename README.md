# WaterDebug
IDA Frida Hook Helper is a plugin for IDA Pro designed to simplify the debugging of .so files and the generation of Frida hook scripts. It supports expression-based jumping (e.g., [[x0] + 0x20]) during debugging and automatically generates Frida hook scripts based on IDA function prototypes, significantly improving reverse engineering efficiency.
